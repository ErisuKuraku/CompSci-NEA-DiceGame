# Dice Game -  GCSE Computer Science OCR

Since our year of GCSEs are cancelled I might as well release the source code I wrote before schools closed to help others.

<b> This code and (some) of the written portion must not be copied but only as a guide to write your own code </b>

While the program is completed, the documentation related to it isn't (due to schools closing) what I have uploaded is what we did until that point.

<b> By downloading the source code you agree to not copy the code or files hosted here and that I'm not blameable / liable if you are caught CTRL + C and CTRL + V  my code and documents </b>

This is defuncted in 2022 anyway since they arn't doing the programming task anymore after that year, cover for 2021 I suppose.

Looking for a simular program but in <b> JavaScript? </b> Check this person out: [Thomas Fairey](https://github.com/tomfairey/DiceRoller)
